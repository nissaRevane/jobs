# Level 3

The car owner now wants her money.
We decide to take a 30% commission on the rental price to cover our costs and have a solid business model.

The commission is split like this:

- half goes to the insurance
- 1â‚¬/day goes to the roadside assistance
- the rest goes to us

Compute the amount that belongs to the insurance, to the assistance and to us.

# Tests

The unit tests use the default ruby librairy `test_unit`. Run these commands to launch the tests
`find tests -name "*.rb" -exec ruby {} \;`
